This is the code repository for the RNA-Seq data analysis I performed for a project that investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic effects of bovine thymus extract on *Caenorhabditis elegans*.

This project resulted in a manuscript (see below) that is currently under review.

Pohl F., Nnamdi C.D., Sanders A., Lambirth K., Reid R.W., et al. 2025. Supplementation with bovine thymus extract improves survival, motility and stress resistance in *C. elegans*. Journal of Functional Foods. \[Manuscript under review\].
